# export_all_subreddit_from_html_page
If you want to export all subreddit that you joined and users you followed. This script will export all of it to a text file for backup or which you can use later to join using another account. I used it to transfer to a secondary account

Save the html page using the link: https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/mine
Once you have it saved as html, modify the python code to point to the html file you saved
Replace the path where you want to export your file

Example of the export:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/
